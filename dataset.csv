Increase conversion rate by showing the perfect content to the right visitor every time
You can test these elements:
    Images, Designs, plugins, text, colors, 
    Price tests, something that didn't exist before. IE they don't have a banner and want us to design a banner and then test it. If they already have a banner but its not published we CAN do that  
    Our consultant comes up with ideas for you to test.  Typically X number of tests.

"Questions/Objections
What if you go down
    If we go down, then it automatically reverts the traffic to Shopify. If they press us we are on Cloudflare and so is Shopify so it wouldn’t really matter but mechanically if Nostra goes down we point the traffic to Shopify. 
What if we don’t see value?
    Refund policy 60 day no questions ask and 30 day trial before the CC is billed
    No one has yet asked for a refund
Who are you main competitors?
    Intellimize for personalization but slow down website and super expensive (wouldnt mention them). Most often we come across Google optimize which lets you run A/B tests but you have to manually do it and it also slows down your website because any JS added to the site will inevitably slow down the site.
    Speed shopify plugins but they dont address the route of the problem which is the server response is bad. Anything downloaded on Shopify can only address client side improvements which will be incremental at best. 
    X,Y,Z (more for me to be aware of their strengths and weaknesses)

"how to demo caching work
Hey, so I'm just gonna show you how fast Nostra. So this is a non-cash version of the page. So we're seeing 1.1 seconds which is obviously not good.
You clicked here. Okay, well, they got a cash version on this one, so that was fast. But let's say you go click here, oh, another cash version so fast.
But if we go to hsf, pva and we wanna see, make sure it's fast, what you can do is you can go in and you can just go to an incognito browser after you go to the normal browser.
So you just clicked around on the normal browser, but you wanna ensure that you get it fast on the iGen Cognito browser what happens is I click on this and it should be cash.
So 300 milliseconds instead of one second. So, you know, a lot faster. The way that our software works is essentially when a visitor hits the website and they click on this page, it should be cashed, or it, it's not cashed.
Let's say. What happens is we store that information on our edge in San Francisco and so that the next time anybody in San Francisco clicks on that page, doesn't matter if it's from this device or any other device the page will be cashed based on who the last visitor was in San Francisco.
And so, so long as there's at least one visitor every four hours, it will remain in cash and keep, you know, everybody will have that fast experience.
And so, you know, it'll be cashed on the edge next to wherever their closest visitor is. So anyways, that's how to explain the speed product.
If you ever want to make sure that when you're giving a demo, it is fast, but make it look real.
The way that you do it is you click around in a non incognito window. So, I don't know which page might not be cash, but I bet that like a random product page for German company isn't cash.
So that's 346 milliseconds and then you give it a, you know, a couple seconds to pro to get into cash, but then we go down to the same product page and it should be loading in 70 milliseconds.
So you could see how that was cashed and if you ever wanna gamify it on a demo, just click around on the site and then click those same pages just in an incognito window so it's not a local storage on a demo.
And you should be able to do it.
",545,"1. What is the difference between the results shown in the normal and incognito browsers?
2. How often does the cached information get updated?
3. How can you ensure that a demo looks fast?","1. The results shown in the normal and incognito browsers are different because the incognito browser is using the cached information.

"Our client is an industry-leading supply chain optimization company for print-on-demand eCommerce businesses.
Our client provide top-of-the-line tailored solutions to their clients for improving cost control procedures, margin analysis, and operational efficiency.
The Challenge:
Because our client wanted to reach as large of an audience as possible with their site, they built up a significant amount of banked content to test different combinations of creatives, copy, and design with their viewers. Unfortunately, it became apparent that they had too much content to efficiently and effectively split test on their site. This made it unnecessarily difficult to generate consistent Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs).
They sought a solution to convert more of their viewers into MQLs by leveraging precise experiences for their visitors. So, our client turned to our team at Nostra to help get them the auto-optimization — and MQLs — they needed while driving results that improved their bottom line.
The Solution:
Our auto-optimization solution determined how and what content to display to each visitor on the website and delivered that content to visitors resulting in a higher conversion rate. With our seamless integration and onboarding process, they were quickly up and running on our platform.
The process to get them up and running required minimal time invested on our client’s end, and most importantly, their site is generating tremendous results.
The Results:
Nostra’s AI is constantly evolving and learning more about our clients’ customer profiles and personas, so the fact that we saw such incredible results within just the first thirty days of working with our client is encouraging for the future. In the first 33 days alone, our Client’s average website conversion rate increased from 8.33% to 21.069%, a 252% lift, generating heaps of new MQLs for our client’s sales team to begin working with. On our best day of the month, we achieved a 40.91% conversion rate.
Almost every day of the first month’s testing period saw a day-over-day improvement in website engagement, stickiness (time spent on site), and lead conversion.
This study helps show the instant results from implementing Nostra’s services on a client’s web pages. We achieved a 2X increase of conversions for website visitors within the while also showing potentially more significant results if utilized for a more extended period.
We’re very pleased with how our partnership with Nostra has panned out so far. We had been struggling with generating consistent MQLs off of our website and needed a creative solution, so we’re thankful that Nostra’s tech could get us the results we wanted. Excited for future tests with the Nostra team!

"Insider Finance, a leading Fintech platform that sells online financial tools, uses Nostra to increase signups and purchases.
Before Nostra, Insider Finance struggled to optimize their website for new customers. They knew that it was important but could not move the needle with traditional split testing. On top of that, as a fast growing business, they never had enough time to run all the experiments they could think of.
Success to Insider Finance looked like more purchases on their site. Nostra helped them achieve this in under 24 days.
To do this, we had to focus on 3 key steps:
    1. Identifying where there was room for improvement.
    2. Creating high quality content.
    3. Using AI to determine what content to show each visitor.

Data + Analysis:
We identified two CTA buttons, two headers and one subtext to try out new variations and built three 3 content variations for each element we wanted to test.
Once the content was built, the Insider Finance team waited on results while focusing on other aspects of their business.
Over the next 24 days we saw the conversion rate jump from 3.65% to ~ 7% on their site.

"Every 10 days Nostra has increased conversions by at least 20%.
Nostra's state of the art AI increases conversions, click through rate and other key metrics by eliminating the manual process of running A/B tests on web pages. In less than 4 weeks, Nostra helped a leading automotive magazine increase the Click Through Rate (CTR) on a critical web page by over 251%.
A leading automotive magazine was looking to increase the amount of visitors who clicked ""Buy Now"" on their website. Previously, they struggled to make significant progress on their CTR by running A/B tests.
As soon as they started with Nostra's AI based solution, they were immediately hooked. The founder of the magazine went on to say, ""It is going to be impossible for me to go back to A/B testing after using Nostra's revolutionary AI optimization software""
After onboarding in less than 30 minutes, Nostra took over. Within 24 days, Nostra increased CTR by over 251%. UPDATE: 3 weeks after the initial test, still with no input from the magazine, the CTR has continued to increase. Every 10 days Nostra has increased conversions by at least 20%. While it is impossible for this to continue forever, it is clear that Nostra's software continuously improves web conversions without requiring human input.
Typical conversion rate optimization softwares that are based on A/B testing level off after testing is complete. Nostra provides a game changing alternative by using AI to continuously optimize web pages without requiring additional time.
After 24 days, the CTR on this market leading automotive magazine is consistently 2.5X the industry average.
Data + Analysis:
Over 24 days, Nostra decreased the cost to acquire a new customer by 19%, increased click through rate (CTR) by 251% (from day 1 to 24) by deciding between 12,754,584 possible combinations of content while requiring less than an hour of work from the client.
Over 50% of “magazine’s” original content from pre Nostra was still being shown on the 24th day. Given Nostra’s system works by finding arbitrage between content pieces and combinations, we expect conversions to be higher the more new content is shown.
Nostra allowed “magazine” to focus their time on content creation and strategy rather than optimizing web pages. In the end, “magazine” was able to see a significant ROI within 1 week of using Nostra’s platform and continues to see improvements in conversions and CTR.
Data that Nostra collected on what content performs well for a given audience will also be used to improve content on paid acquisition channels. For example, we can determine for ""FB Ad 1"" that ""image 2"" performs better than ""image 1"" and can suggest updating ""FB Ad 1"" with ""image 2"" rather than ""image 1"". As well, our AI can suggest what time of day to display different content and advertisements.
Setup Process:
We use the information we collect in various ways, including to:
Provide specific access to content management system (or custom-built website), content delivery network and cloud provider.
Insert the Nostra Tracking Script in the header of web pages that are going to be optimized.
Construct and approve content to be tested.
“The ease of integration as well as increased conversions allowed us to experiment at a rate that I have never experienced before. We gave Nostra the proper access, got the content ready and then handed the keys over to the Nostra team and they optimized our site. The entire process was quick, easy and provided an incredible ROI” -Founder “magazine”
